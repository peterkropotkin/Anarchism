* russia: the black raids. a timeline here. longer discussion here, particularly of the kronstadt rebellion and the betrayal of the ukranian anarchists. the bolsheviks also betrayed the Left SRs.

* germany: the ruling democratic socialists put down spartacist uprising of 1919. (libertarian marxist, not anarchist). There were several socialist republics formed at the same time, notably in Bavaria, which were also put down. anarchists and libertarian communists were repressed later in 47-the uprising of 53 in east germany.

* shinmin: the marxists literally assassinated the anarchist leaders

* china: Chinese Anarchism is fascinating. one of the few (only?) instances of an anarchist repression of marxists (before the KMT went fascist), they were eventually just out-organized. later, in the cultural revolution, people actually believed mao, and there was a swift move to crush the anarchists of the shanghai commune and elsewhere. the current repression of the CPC is obvious.

* spain: i'm somehow not aware of a snappy timeline of marxist betrayal of the anarchists in spain. basically the ussr contributed resources to the revolution, but on strict conditions which were against the anarchists. they *did* organize the international brigades, but they constantly spread lies about the anarchists and undermined them at every turn, and finally betrayed them during the may days of 37. their demand that the war be prioritized over the revolution i.e. "the revolution can wait" (where have we heard this before?) disrupted the success of the anarchist militias and navy, they literally attacked and disbanded CNT aligned collectives in the countryside. much is written about it here and a shorter, more broad summary here.

* hungary: the reds abandoned them after 1919 to the first fascist dictatorship, then when they invaded in 44, they rubberstamped horthy. colin ward writes about hungary 56 and czech 68 here, but there is a lot more on libcom.

* greece: the greek communist party (KKE) murdered hundreds of anarchists and internationalist communists in 1944

* vietnam: ho chi minh massacred the libertarian socialist movement after the victory of 45

* cuba: actual assassinations were rare, but exiles were enforced and repression was explicit. che personally oversaw the ejection of anarchists from prominent positions in the unions, which they were very popular in.

* france: anarchists and libertarian marxists generated a strike wave that led to 2/3 of all firms in france being occupied. the marxist led CGT union eventually joined in after criticizing it and authorized millions of their members to strike. then they called off the revolution after the president fled. the french communist party only suggested new elections
